# PyQt5-Budgeting-App
Fully functional, GUI application, made with PyQt5 in the programming language of Python. This app is a budgeting app that allows the user to enter different budgeting line items which include the name of the item and how much it is valued. As a result the app will save the item inside of its built-in database which remembers items between budgeting sessions. The user is allowed to update items they have already saved in their budget as well as delete previously entered items. There is a "Clear Budget" button which clears the entire budget on press.
